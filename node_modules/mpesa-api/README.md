:zap: :bomb: :fire: :fire: :bomb: :zap:

An NPM Module built with NodeJs to help you with M-Pesa Daraja API calls.

> **Looking for contributors who can help write tests.**

Ready Methods

- [x] C2BSIMULATE
- [ ] B2B
- [x] C2B
- [x] B2C
- [ ] TRANSACTION STATUS
- [x] ACCOUNT BALANCE
- [ ] REVERSAL
- [x] LIPA NA MPESA

## Prerequisites

1.  Node 6+.
2.  NPM(comes with Node) or Yarn.

## Installation

Mpesa-Api uses Node Package Manager

```
npm i mpesa-api
```

Or Yarn

```
yarn add mpesa-api
```

## Requisites

You Will need a few things from Safaricom before development.

1.  Consumer Key
2.  Consumer Secret
3.  Test Credentials for Development/Sanbox environment

- Login or Register as a Safaricom developer [here](https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/login-register) if you haven't.
- Add a new App [here](https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/user/me/apps)
- You will be issued with a Consumer Key and Consumer Secret. You will use these to initiate an Mpesa Instance.
- Obtain Test Credentials [here](https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/test_credentials).
  - The Test Credentials Obtained Are only valid in Sandbox/Development environment. Take note of them.
  - To run in Production Environment you will need real Credentials.
    - To go Live and be issued with real credentials,please refer to [this guide](https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/docs?javascript#going-live)

## Getting Started

```javascript
// import package
import { Mpesa } from "mpesa-api";
//OR
const Mpesa = require("mpesa-api").Mpesa;

// create a new instance of the api
const mpesa = new Mpesa(credentials, environment);
```

A moment to explain the above. `credentials` should be an object containing key,secret,initiator_password and certificatepath as the properties.

```javascript
//example
const credentials = {
    client_key: 'YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY_HERE',
    client_secret: 'YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET_HERE',
    initiator_password: 'YOUR_INITIATOR_PASSWORD_HERE',
    certificatepath: 'keys/example.cert'
};
// For the initiator_password, use the security credential from the test credentials page.link :https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/test_credentials

// certificate path is otional. I've provided ceritificates for sandbox and production by default. If you choose not to include it Pass it as null.
const credentials = {
    ...,
    certificatepath: null
};
```

> You can get initiator password from Your Portal(production) or from test credentials(Sandbox). It will be the `Security Credential (Shortcode 1)`.

Environment should be a string. It can be either 'production' or 'sandbox'

```javascript
const environment = "sandbox";
//or
const environment = "production";
```

## Methods and Api Calls

#### Business to Business

> This Has Been Disabled as of January 2019 and I have therefore removed it for now.

This API enables Business to Business (B2B) transactions between a business and another business. Use of this API requires a valid and verified B2B M-Pesa short code for the business initiating the transaction and the both businesses involved in the transaction.

```javascript
mpesa
  .b2b({
    InitiatorName: "Initiator Name",
    Amount: 1000 /* 1000 is an example amount */,
    PartyA: "Party A",
    PartyB: "Party B",
    AccountReference: "Account Reference",
    QueueTimeOutURL: "Queue Timeout URL",
    ResultURL: "Result URL",
    CommandID: "Command ID" /* OPTIONAL */,
    SenderIdentifierType: 4 /* OPTIONAL */,
    RecieverIdentifierType: 4 /* OPTIONAL */,
    Remarks: "Remarks" /* OPTIONAL */
  })
  .then(response => {
    //Do something with the response
    //eg
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    //Do something with the error;
    //eg
    console.error(error);
  });
```

1.  Initiator - This is the credential/username used to authenticate the transaction request.
2.  CommandID - Unique command for each transaction type, default is `MerchantToMerchantTransfer` possible values are: `BusinessPayBill`, `MerchantToMerchantTransfer`, `MerchantTransferFromMerchantToWorking`, `MerchantServicesMMFAccountTransfer`, `AgencyFloatAdvance`

10. ResultURL - The path that receives results from M-Pesa it should be properly validated to make sure that it contains the port, URI and domain name or publicly available IP.
11. AccountReference - Account Reference mandatory for “BusinessPaybill” CommandID.

#### Business to Customer (B2C)

This API enables Business to Customer (B2C) transactions between a company and customers who are the end-users of its products or services. Use of this API requires a valid and verified B2C M-Pesa Short code.

```javascript

  .b2c({
    InitiatorName: "Initiator Name",
    Amount: 1000 /* 1000 is an example amount */,
    PartyA: "Party A",
    PartyB: "Party B",
    QueueTimeOutURL: "Queue Timeout URL",
    ResultURL: "Result URL",

    //eg
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    //Do something with the error;
    //eg
    console.error(error);
  });
```

1.  InitiatorName - This is the credential/username used to authenticate the transaction request.
2.  CommandID - Unique command for each transaction type e.g. SalaryPayment, BusinessPayment, PromotionPayment
3.  Amount - The amount being transacted
4.  PartyA - Organization’s shortcode initiating the transaction.
5.  PartyB - Phone number receiving the transaction

#### C2B

This API enables Paybill and Buy Goods merchants to integrate to M-Pesa and receive real time payments notifications.

##### Register

The C2B Register URL API registers the 3rd party’s confirmation and validation URLs to M-Pesa ; which then maps these URLs to the 3rd party shortcode. Whenever M-Pesa receives a transaction on the shortcode, M-Pesa triggers a validation request against the validation URL and the 3rd party system responds to M-Pesa with a validation response (either a success or an error code). The response expected is the success code the 3rd party

M-Pesa completes or cancels the transaction depending on the validation response it receives from the 3rd party system. A confirmation request of the transaction is then sent by M-Pesa through the confirmation URL back to the 3rd party which then should respond with a success acknowledging the confirmation.

```javascript
mpesa
  .c2bregister({
    ShortCode: "Short Code",
    ConfirmationURL: "Confirmation URL",
    ValidationURL: "Validation URL",
    ResponseType: "Response Type"
  })
  .then(response => {
    //Do something with the response
    //eg
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    //Do something with the error;
    //eg
    console.error(error);
  });
```

1.  ShortCode - The short code of the organization.
2.  ResponseType - Default response type for timeout.
3.  ConfirmationURL- Confirmation URL for the client.
4.  ValidationURL - Validation URL for the client.

##### Simulate

    Msisdn: 254792123456,
    CommandID: "Command ID" /* OPTIONAL */,
    BillRefNumber: "Bill Reference Number" /* OPTIONAL */
  })
  .then(response => {
    //Do something with the response
    //eg
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    //Do something with the error;
    //eg
    console.error(error);
